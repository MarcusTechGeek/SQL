1. Appropriate Data Type for Mileage Column
Question:Your company delivers fruit and vegetables to local grocery stores, and you need to track the mileage driven by each driver each day to a tenth of a mile.

Answer: The appropriate data type for the mileage column would be `NUMERIC(5,1)`.

2. Appropriate Data Types for Drivers’ Names

Answer: The appropriate data type for both the first and last names would be `VARCHAR`.
